# Local LLM Integration Plan

## Current Status
- System uses OpenAI API (GPT-4-turbo)
- Multiple agents with different roles:
  - Summarizer
  - Classifier
  - Novelty Assessor
  - Scorer

## LMStudio Integration Plan

### 1. Model Testing Framework
1. [ ] Create test suite for evaluating models:
   - Internet access capability
   - Context window size
   - Response quality for each agent role
   - Performance metrics
   - Memory usage
   - Response time

### 2. Model Selection Process
Test following capabilities for each role:

#### Summarizer Agent
- [ ] Test models optimized for text summarization
- [ ] Evaluate comprehension accuracy
- [ ] Compare with baseline GPT-4 summaries

#### Classifier Agent
- [ ] Test models with good categorical reasoning
- [ ] Evaluate classification accuracy
- [ ] Assess consistency in classifications

#### Novelty Assessor
- [ ] Test models with internet access
- [ ] Evaluate ability to compare with existing research
- [ ] Check reasoning capabilities

#### Scorer Agent
- [ ] Test models with strong analytical capabilities
- [ ] Evaluate scoring consistency
- [ ] Compare with human expert ratings

### 3. Technical Integration
1. [ ] Create LMStudio client wrapper
2. [ ] Implement model switching capability
3. [ ] Add fallback mechanisms
4. [ ] Set up proper error handling
5. [ ] Implement response validation

### 4. Performance Optimization
1. [ ] Implement response caching
2. [ ] Add batch processing where applicable
3. [ ] Optimize prompt templates
4. [ ] Add monitoring and logging

## Testing Strategy
1. [ ] Create benchmark dataset
2. [ ] Define success metrics
3. [ ] Set up A/B testing framework
4. [ ] Implement automated testing pipeline
