# LastWeek-MustRead-Arxiv

An intelligent arXiv paper analysis system that automatically discovers, processes, and ranks the most relevant recent research papers based on your interests.

## Features

- ü§ñ Automated daily paper collection from arXiv
- üìä Multi-agent system architecture for sophisticated paper analysis:
  - Paper scraping from arXiv
  - Intelligent summarization
  - Topic classification
  - Novelty assessment
  - Relevance scoring
- üóÉÔ∏è Persistent storage of paper analyses in SQLite database
- üìà Daily report generation with ranked papers
- üéØ Configurable interest areas and categories
- ‚öôÔ∏è Flexible scheduling (run once or schedule daily)

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Run once immediately:
```bash
python main.py --mode once
```

Run as a scheduled service (runs daily at 2 AM):
```bash
python main.py --mode schedule
```

## Configuration

Edit the `setup_config()` function in `main.py` to customize:
- Interested research fields
- arXiv categories to monitor
- Maximum papers to process per run
- LLM model and parameters
- Database path

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Core application logic and pipeline orchestration
- `agents/`: Individual AI agents for different analysis tasks
- `database/`: Database management and persistence layer
- `papers.db`: SQLite database for storing paper analyses
- `requirements.txt`: Project dependencies

## Output

The system generates:
- Daily CSV reports with ranked papers
- Detailed paper analyses in the SQLite database
- Logging information about the analysis process
